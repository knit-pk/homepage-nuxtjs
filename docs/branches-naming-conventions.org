* Branch naming conventions in the project:

Quoting the @k911:

- ~feature/slug-name~ -> new feature and it should be pointing to develop branch or another feature branch

  *Branch must be created from develop or another feature branch!*

- ~bugfix/slug-name~ -> bugfix branch for develop branch i.e. issue does not occurr on master branch (it occurrs on dev env but not on prod pre-production env)

  *Branch must be created from develop branch!*

- ~hotfix/slug-name~ -> hotfix branch for both develop and master branches, bug occurrs on every environment.

  It should be represented by two PRs:
  - one pointing master
  - and one develop

  (Purpose for the hotfix branch is to be able to release fix on prod, pre-prod envs, without accidentally addition of features)

  *Branch must be created from master branch!*
